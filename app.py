            We all known that Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs

            Fortunately, most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

            People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management. \n 
            Hence, we decided to implement a machine learning model in order to detect and prevent the people from being passed away by heart failure.

            Preview Data is to simply display the data of our patients. Perhap you do not want to 
            view the whole dataframe, but rather to see the filtered data that you did at the left sidebar. then you can
            adjust the filter while you preview data as well. We also provide you two ways to download your filtered dataset
            as csv and excel file.
            If you need a deeper analysis, then it's worth trying 
            to generate a report (for your filtered data) even it may take a half minute to generate.

            Good thing about the report you generated is that you can see the interaction of any pair of features.
